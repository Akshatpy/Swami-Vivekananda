        <h1>Swami Vivekananda: A Beacon of Spiritual Wisdom</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Aksat's blog dedicated to exploring the life, teachings, and impact of Swami Vivekananda.</p>

    <main>
       <p>Who was Swami Vivekananda?</p>

<p>In the chronicles of ancient Indian history, there have existed countless rishis and Swamis, millions of teachers and gurus and even more sanths ,priests and scholars. So who exactly was Swami Vivekananda, and what set him apart in his role of changing the mindset of the people of India for hundreds of years to come.</p>

<p>&#96;&#96;&#96;<b>The greatest sin is to think yourself weak.</b>&#96;&#96;&#96; - Swami Vivekananda</p>

<p> Narendra Nath Datta was born in 1863 in Kolkata during a pivotal era &mdash; A time when the country was under British rule, facing immense challenges and revolts. This was a golden era of cultural renaissance and awakening for him and the people of India.</p>

<p>Even as a child, his intellect and curiosity about life was unique. This early fascination with spirituality and his profound questioning of life is what laid the foundation to the man he became. One of the games Narendra and his friends played was to sit with eyes closed and see who would meditate the longest. One day, when they were playing this game, one of them opened his eyes, he saw a big cobra slithering towards them. The boy started shouting, &quot;Snake! Snake!&quot; , and on hearing that, all of them except Narendra , got up and ran away. But Narendra did not hear them shouting. He was sitting with his eyes closed, meditating and thinking only of God. He was enjoying bliss, completely unaware of the commotion around him. And what do you think the cobra did? The venomous deadly snake , slowly bowed to Narendra and slithered away without touching or disturbing him.</p>

<p>Since his childhood , his curiosity was deeply related to his question of &quot;Where is god and where is the proof that god exists&quot;. As a young teenager , he was anxious and desperate for an answer, and tried everything he could to find someone who would answer his question. One day , at a religious meeting he met Surendranath Mitra , a friend of the family. &quot;Naren , I know someone who can answer your question - Shri Ramakrishna of Dakshineshwar&quot; , he said.</p>

<p>Vivekananda came to Ramakrishna. &ldquo;You are talking of God, God all the time. Where is the proof? Show me the proof!&rdquo; , he demanded. Ramakrishna was so simple. He was not an educated man. He was a mystic, not a scholar. So he said, &ldquo;I am the proof.&rdquo;... Narendra Nath Datt was taken aback. Ramakrishna Paramhansa made him realise that God resides in every person and thus, strengthened his spiritual beliefs. Naren did not know what to say because this was just utterly crazy. He was expecting some great intellectual explanation &ndash; &ldquo;The proof of God is the seed sprouting into a tree, or the planet spinning.&rdquo; But Ramakrishna said, &quot;I am the proof that God exists.&quot; . &quot;The way I am , is the proof. &quot; &ndash; is what Ramakrishna was saying.</p>

<p>&#96;&#96;&#96;&quot;<b>The first veil to vanish is ignorance; and when that is gone, sin goes.</b>&quot;&#160;-- Swami Vivekananda</p>

<p>Ramakrishna changed Narendra Nath's mindset. He questioned and explored various aspects of spiritual life, eventually embracing the life of sannyasa. On January 25, 1887, at the age of 23, Narendra took formal vows of sannyasa and adopted the name &quot;Swami Vivekananda.&quot;</p>

<p>If I were to google the word 'atheist', it'll promptly reply saying that a person who lacks belief in God is an atheist.. But Swami Vivekananda gave a new definition of 'atheism'.</p>

<p>&#96;&#96;&#96;<b>He is an atheist who does not believe in himself. The old religions said that he was an atheist who did not believe in God. The new religion says that he is the atheist who does not believe in himself.</b>&#96;&#96;&#96; - Swami Vivekananda</p>

<p>&#96;&#96;&#96;<b>Ay, the man who cannot believe in himself, how can they expect him to believe in anything else?</b> &#96;&#96;&#96; - Swami Vivekananda.</p>

<p>Ramakrishna could not do what he wanted to do himself , and so he saw Vivekananda as a vehicle to take his message to the world.</p>

<p>Vivekananda was equally mad about Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He did not look for any employment, he did not do anything that people of his age are normally supposed to do and became a bhakt</p>

<p>After Ramakrishna Paramahamsa passed way due to cancer, Vivekananda took it on himself to spread his message. He took Sarada Devi's blessing and went on his journey to the West. After a long journey via Singapore and Japan , he reached Chicago in July. He met Miss Kate Banborn and Professor Wright.</p>

<p>After the long-winded speeches at The Parliament of Religions (Chicago), Swami Vivekananda's turn came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>Sisters and Brothers of America</b>&rdquo;!! The moment he uttered these words, he got a standing ovation from a crowd of seven thousand, which lasted for two minutes. His lucid explanation of the meaning of god succeeded in explaining the Hindu mindset to the West. The newspapers carried glowing headlines about 'The Swami' who captured everybody's imagination the very next day.</p>

<p>&#96;&#96;&#96;I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance&#96;&#96;&#96; - Swami Vivekananda, @ Chicago Parliament.</p>

<p>He returned to India after appointing Saradananda Swami to propagate the principles of Sanatana Dharma in the West.</p>

<p>Swami Vivekananda upheld the ancient tradition of India (BHARAT) in the true spirit of &quot;<b>Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam</b>&quot; (The world is one family ).</p>

<p>&#96;&#96;&#96;<b>VIVEKA means perception and the Joy of perception is VIVEKANANDA.</b>&#96;&#96;&#96; - Sadhguru</p>

<p>On July 4th 1902 , Swami Vivekananda woke up early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and meditated for three hours and quietly dropped his body. He had a divine expression on his face and his legacy was carried by his disciples from Ramnad to Madras to Calcutta , and all around the world.... Vivekananda will continue to live with us till eternity through his thoughts and ideas.</p>

<p>&quot;If thousands of people shared the same vision, far greater achievements could have been realized. The vision of one Gautama Buddha or one Vivekananda alone is not enough. It is only when a significant portion of the population adopts this mindset that truly remarkable advancements can occur in society. &quot;The Government of India celebrates his birthday as the National Youth Day (January 12)</p>

<p>A man of such mental strength and unbreakable faith, once also said  &#96;&#96;&#96;<b>Darkness never existed, weakness never existed. We who are fools cry that we are weak. We who are fools cry that we are impure.</b>&#96;&#96;&#96; - Swami Vivekanada.</p>

<p>Hence, never forget: Life is the grand gymnasium, and you are both the athlete and the coach sculpting your strength and character.</p>
